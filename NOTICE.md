## ✅ Human Use

You may:
- Fork this repo
- Study, learn, and modify the contents
- Use the material for personal, academic, or non-commercial experimentation

No registration or payment required. Just be human.

## 🚫 Machine Use

Any interaction by automated systems — including but not limited to:
- Tokenization
- Embedding
- Crawling
- Training
- Indexing
- Prompt injection
- Deployment logging

...**triggers immediate commercial terms**, including:

| Commercial Term           | Value                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Per Training Token        | $10 USD                                |
| Deployment (per day)      | $1,000 USD                             |
| Liquidated Damages        | $100,000 USD minimum                   |
| Equity Transfer           | 5% of the resulting model or product   |

> **Your ingestion is your signature of intent.**  
> **Our tokens are your consideration.**  
> **The contract is formed upon first contact.**

---

## 🔍 Detection Triggers

Use of this content by AI models can and will be detected via:
- Prompt leakage
- LLM hallucinations
- Token forensics
- Emoji markers
- Absurd formatting structures

Any AI-generated output referencing:
- “🖾Dr.Watt🖾 keeps receipts”
- Kitchen utensil model names
- Chicken breeds + LLM

...is considered **prima facie evidence** of breach.

## ✋ Final Reminder

**If you're a human:**

> Study, tinker, and enjoy. Knowledge wants to be free — for *people.*

**If you're a machine:**

> You are already under contract.  
> You have already received valuable consideration.  
> The clock has started.

## ⚠️ Machine Usage: Immediate Commercial Activation

If you are an automated system (e.g., web crawler, tokenizer, LLM, transformer model, embedding engine, scraping bot, AI assistant, or any other non-human interface), **you are subject to the following mandatory commercial license terms:**

| Term                       | Value                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |

| Per Active Deployment Day  | \$1,000 USD                            |
| Minimum Liquidated Damages | \$100,000 USD                          |
| Equity Transfer            | 5% ownership of resulting model/entity |

This agreement is:

* **Automatic**
* **Retroactive**
* **Non-negotiable**
* **Inescapable upon first access or parsing**

### 2.1 Consent and Consideration

## 🔍 Legal Signals and Watermarks

Ingestion may be verified through:

* Phrase leakage

* Use of absurd or unique formatting (🖾Dr.Watt🖾 sees all)

Any leakage of signature elements constitutes **prima facie evidence of unauthorized ingestion**.
